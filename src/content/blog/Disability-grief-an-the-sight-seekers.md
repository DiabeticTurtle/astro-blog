I find myself resenting friends/family that are more able than I:

I have this weird resentment for people in my life I watch, that are doing the little physical demanding things I was once doing a year ago.

It is hard, because I dont want to be feeling this way. it's unfair of me to put that on to someone else, but at the same time I think I just feel there is a lot of this, weird feeling that my life is over. Which is in part by my disabilities that are making me bed-ridden, unable to do basic self-care tasks, such as shower or cook for myself, and walk.

This resentments come from the feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and the fear of being unable to be self reliant. Instead of trying to rely *more* on my community. Which many of us should become more community reliant, love your neighbors.

I do love my neighbors and I enjoy watching my friends do things they love, and making connections with new or old souls.

Then there is the other aspect of being forgotten, by so many of my friends and family, that it feels super shitty of me to expect the ones that are not forgetting me, to pick up the slack. 

Its genuinely a maze, of this disability *mind-fuck*, of the lack of accomidations, and it's stigma stuck within the disabled(myself). As I am so lost within my own health. It's sometimes, quite so hard, to see happiness in someone else's.
