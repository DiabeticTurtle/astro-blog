I don’t know what I need or want to say. I always press this button to record myself after having a good conversation in my head, but once I press it, I forget everything. 

I keep getting taken advantage of. It pushes me closer to wanting to give up, even though I care so deeply for many people.

I genuinely love people and value connection. I enjoy seeing different perspectives even if I disagree, I learn something and gain new ways to see myself. I don’t think many people can do that; it’s rare and such a rich way to live, in my opinion. It can feel overwhelming, but once you find peace within yourself and your values, you can thrive in this kind of life.

I can’t work like I used to, which means I can’t support myself unless I sell my plasma. I could do it, but the stigma around health issues is so messed up. Everyone has advice telling me to eat cinnamon or garlic or okra to “cure” my diabetes as if my hormones would start working by eating something. That stigma has shaped my life, and even doctors fall into it, misdiagnosing and pushing it onto their patients.

Then there’s the stigma with covid. How it spreads, the lack of precautions, and while covid does cause serious issues for many people, it doesn’t impact everyone the same way. The disconnect is that it only affects some, yet the people it affects don’t always realize it was covid. So, we (covid long haulers) are severely undiagnosed. Many diabetics are also un\misdiagnosed, mistreated, or undertreated because of how the system is built. I’ve advocated for disability justice my whole life, and it’s more apparent than ever that the system is built on the stigma that is against people who need better accommodations.

The reality is we’ve evolved to connect, to rely on each other, yet we’re stuck accommodating ourselves. We get lost in hate and frustration at a system that keeps failing people, when all we’re asking for is better care not for those with bigger wallets, but for those who need it.

It’s depressing to see how every human on this planet is affected by greed and gluttony. They say these are sins, but they’re more than that , they harm us all, not just your door to Utopia


I've seen and grew up around this cult-like thinking. It scared me to see how similar that mentality is to our society: if you don’t live a certain way, you’re excluded. When your needs aren’t met, you struggle. You’re stuck depending on people who may not understand or want to help.

Some have to play the system to survive, while trying to understand it then also, take care and love of ones-self. While trying to dismantle the broken parts of the system. It's a lot of work!

My friends have taught me so much about self-love. They understand life from their unique perspectives, and they fall back to give love, understanding, and appreciation. Those are the kinds people I want to be surrounded by. So I can know the many different ways to give that back to them, and to everyone I meet.  


Many of my friends have lived their whole lives against this broken system. Some, in every way deeper than I have. They work within it because they have to, and they adapted to it because of the privileges the system takes from them. That many of us take for granted. 

The system is like a game of privilege. If you look and act a certain way, you’re more privileged than those who don’t fit that mold. I’ve always felt it, but I’m understanding it now at a deeper level than ever before. It’s a broken system, and it’s what the over-privileged have continued to build.

I wish more people realized this, but it’s hard. I don’t know how to discuss or debate it. Maybe I need to write about it, do the research, but in a way, I feel stuck. I’ve always been taken advantage of, and realizing it more now than ever is such a hard feeling. I have put myself in situations where my body was harmed, even if it was small at first, It still made me more broken than ever.

I get stuck in these unemployment phases where I physically can’t work. People complain about helping me through it, but in reality, it’s the lack of accommodations, understanding, and knowledge that deepens my unemployment. To claim they “helped” when they didn’t do anything real for me, it’s frustrating.

Right now, I’m sitting on the privilege I have. While I’m stuck in misinformation, stigma, and misunderstandings. I wish I could create something meaningful with my mind because I can’t break my body anymore.


I've been feeling so isolated because of what COVID has done to my body. When I share my experience, people judge me in ways they wouldn’t want to be judged themselves. But when I "judge" people, it’s really just me expressing the limitations I face because of a virus. There’s a lack of love and understanding from every social pool

People struggle to believe I'm acting out of love. They can’t imagine that wearing a mask does so much for themselves and more so others. They have their priorities, but why is it so polarizing to wear a piece of fabric when you go out? I’d love to see your face as much as you want to show it, but I don’t want to risk my health by doing so.

The people I’ve been fortunate enough to love, and who have loved me back, understand this. I want those people to share themselves with everyone because they care deeply. They love themselves, their friends, and the world around them. They understand that caring is powerful.

People often appreciate my thoughtfulness as its something i strive for, because I care. It’s easy for me to care. I urge people to practice self-love and break out of stigma, because it has changed my life, and I want others to experience that.

But remember, life expectancy only gets harder with misinformed decisions. Many are stuck in this invisible game; this chess game driven by big pharma and systematic eugenics, where people are pawns, more fortunate than I am, yet still caught in a system designed to fail us. You may feel judged by me, but that’s because I’m advocating for health. When I see people disregard this, it saddens me. Loving and caring for yourself is difficult. its taken me a long time to figure out, as I still learn.

It’s challenging to accept love and health, to embrace self-care. I sometimes feel like I'm stigmatizing myself because of how urgently I share my experiences. It’s easy to feel lost, wondering, “Why continue on when no one cares about me, or themselves, or others?” But I keep going because I love myself. I’m not going to harm myself just because I can’t convince others to mask.

Masking taught me self-love at a molecular level, literally. I care for myself, and that’s supported by science. I know not everyone understands or will want to understand. Many people never have and never will, and advocating often feels like wasted energy.

I wish I didn’t have to be isolated. I wish it wasn’t so hard, and that more people could love themselves as the people I’m grateful to know do. These people have taught me self-care in countless ways, and I wish the broader community understood the stigma and reality of health needs. I understand that some can’t mask because it can be challenging, but it’s hard to advocate for safety in a world overpopulated and polluted to the point where everyone, not just disabled people, needs clean air and protective measures.

Balancing health with life’s demands is easier for able-bodied people. I tell my story and am often shunned or criticized for "judging" others. But this is my experience, my life. If people hate me for sharing my reality, so be it.

I want people to think critically about the challenges disabled individuals face, but disabled voices often go unnoticed. COVID only highlighted an already broken system, one I’ve been part of for too long. I’ve watched disabled friends go unseen, and now I’m fighting to make sure I don’t go unnoticed myself. I used to believe my disability didn’t require better accommodations, convinced by society that seeking help would reflect poorly on me.

Now, I unapologetically love my disabled comrades. If you don’t care, then I don’t need your approval. My story matters.

Im sick of being pushed out, seeing my friends kill themselves cause of the f~~uck~~ed up system we all live in. Falling to what the system is built for. "Fixing" the population by ignoring the people who are different.


I don't really know much more about how to work against the system. love is how often how I gotten through this life so far. Mostly it being taken too far advantage of. that's what made me learn how to understand the love of others and where my love is deserving of, its certainly not at others who don't care if I live or die. so I shed my love to other aspects of my life centering myself.
